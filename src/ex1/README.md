# VHDL Example 1 (`src/ex1/`)

This directory contains a simple VHDL example.

## Files

- `package.vhdl`: A VHDL package file. This likely contains constant declarations, type definitions, or subprogram declarations used within this example.
- `test.vhdl`: A VHDL testbench file. This is used to simulate and verify the functionality of the VHDL design components defined or used in this example.
- `BUILD.bazel`: The Bazel build file for this example, defining how to build and test the VHDL code.

## Purpose

This example likely serves to demonstrate:
- Basic VHDL package creation and usage.
- Testbench structure and simulation in VHDL.
