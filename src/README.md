# Source Code (`src/`)

This directory contains all the HDL source code for the examples in this project.

## Subdirectories

- `dff/`: A D-type flip-flop implemented in SystemVerilog. This includes the DFF module, a top-level wrapper, and associated files.
- `ex1/`: A simple VHDL example demonstrating basic entity-architecture structure.
- `ex2/`: A VHDL example showcasing a different VHDL concept or feature.
- `ex3/`: Another VHDL example, potentially building on previous ones or introducing new ideas.
- `ex4/`: A VHDL example that includes the use of a VHDL library.
- `twoproc/`: A VHDL example implementing a design using the two-process methodology.

Each subdirectory contains the HDL files for that specific example, along with a `BUILD.bazel` file for Bazel integration.
