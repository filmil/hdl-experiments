# VHDL Example 3 (`src/ex3/`)

This directory contains a VHDL example.

## Files

- `ex3.vhdl`: This file contains the VHDL code for a design component, likely including both the `entity` declaration and `architecture` body in a single file.
- `BUILD.bazel`: The Bazel build file for this example, used for compiling and managing this VHDL module.

## Purpose

This example likely serves to demonstrate:
- A specific VHDL construct or design pattern.
- A self-contained VHDL component.
- Further examples of VHDL syntax and structure.
